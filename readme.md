# Project 2 Name
"Meal Rep"

# Tech Stack
Postgres, Express, Node

# API Being Used
Nutritionix API
https://developer.nutritionix.com/


# Example of req & res
User enters name of food item and with the API returns the nutrition facts for that item including, name, picture, calories, protein, carbs.

# MPV Goals
* When users put the name of a food into a search bar the nutrition facts and pictures come up 
* Users able to select favorite foods
* On Home screen common foods are already listed for user convenience

# Stretch Goals
* Use interpolation or some other method to display total macros of favorites list 
* Have different drop down menus listing the nutrition facts for different food groups 

# Potential Roadblocks
I'm not sure how well utilizing bootstrap would work with this project so a roadblock might be making it look presentable on the client side for users.
